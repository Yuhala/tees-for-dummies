# Intel trust domain extensions (TDX)

# Hardware setup
- In general, TDX is supporeted on 5th Gen Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable processors and Intel速 Xeon速 6 processors.
- [This README](https://github.com/canonical/tdx/blob/3.3/README.md) from Canonical provides dummy-friendly instructions to setup and test TDX.
- In the above guide, a dummy may not need to test the remote attestation steps, so feel free to skip. Nevertheless, it becomes a critical step when deploying production software on a TDX server hosted by a third party.
